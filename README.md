- 👋 Hi, I’m @jlucas1980
- 👀 I’m interested in biking, road trips and traveling to different countries. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ELAN, and working on completing my MSc in data science. I will be graduating Summer 2023.
- 💞️ I’m currently collaborating on The DREAM project; manipulating an AI in the American Sign Language database using ELAN and Tableau. Main focus is using data gathered from ELAN to explain the connection between mouth/mothing and just simple hand movements when commmunicating. "The use of American Sign Language requires more than just simple hand movements to convey a message.  Without the use of proper facial expressions and other non manual signals (NMS), a message could be greatly misunderstood.  Involved in these non manual signals are one's eyes, eyebrows, cheeks and mouth.  These must be used to communicate clearly and effectively in daily conversations (Valli & Lucas, 21)." With the help of my team Maria Saenz and Nicole Barnekow we will gather data to look at specific mouth movements to see if there is any resemblance or correlation to spoken English.
